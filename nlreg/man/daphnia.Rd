\title{`Daphnia Magna' Data}
\description{
  The \code{daphnia} data frame has 136 rows and 2 columns.

  Ecotoxicity study to assess the impact of the herbicide dinoseb on 
  the survival of \emph{Daphnia magna} Strauss, 1820, a 
  micro-crustacean widely used as test organism in aquatic 
  ecotoxicological assays.  The design of the experiment includes 35 
  irregularly spaced concentrations ranging from 0.006 to 11.3 mg/l 
  and a control group.  The upper endpoint of 11.3 mg/l is the highest
  concentration at which the test substance is soluble in the test 
  medium.  The number of replicates per concentration varies from 1 to
  11 experimental units.  The survival time is measured in days.
